# 🏠 /home/kabaneridev/.pt-notes

Welcome to my penetration testing notes page - a project started with the idea to share and document my knowledge gained in the world of offensive security.

My current knowledge comes from CTFs, real world penetration testing, but also from studying for certifications such as the PJPT, CPTS.
