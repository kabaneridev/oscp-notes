## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigations

### üîê **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
```powershell
# Implementation considerations:
- Push notifications to mobile devices
- Rotating One Time Passwords (OTP) - Google Authenticator, RSA tokens
- SMS text message confirmations
- Hardware security keys (FIDO2, U2F)
- Biometric authentication
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- Some MFA implementations still disclose valid username/password combinations
- Credentials may be reusable against other services without MFA
- Implement MFA on **all** external portals and critical applications

### üö™ **Access Restrictions**
```powershell
# Principle of least privilege:
- Restrict application access to users who require it
- Implement role-based access controls (RBAC)
- Regular access reviews and cleanup
- Disable unnecessary service accounts
- Limit domain user application access
```

### üéØ **Reducing Impact of Successful Exploitation**
```powershell
# Defensive strategies:
- Separate privileged accounts for administrative activities
- Application-specific permission levels
- Network segmentation (isolate compromised subnets)
- Just-in-Time (JIT) administrative access
- Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions
```

### üîë **Password Hygiene**
```powershell
# Password policies and education:
- Encourage passphrases over complex passwords
- Implement password filters for:
  * Common dictionary words
  * Months and seasons (Spring, Winter, etc.)
  * Company name variations
  * Sequential patterns (123, abc)
- Regular password security training
- Password manager adoption
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Lockout Policy Considerations**
```powershell
# Balanced approach:
- Avoid overly restrictive lockout policies (DoS risk)
- Consider account lockout duration vs. manual unlock
- Implement progressive delays instead of hard lockouts
- Monitor for mass lockout events
- Exception handling for service accounts
```

## üîç Detection

### üìä **Key Event IDs to Monitor**

#### üö® **Event ID 4625: Account Failed to Log On**
```powershell
# Indicators of password spraying:
- Multiple 4625 events in short time period
- Same source IP across multiple usernames
- Failed attempts with valid usernames
- Patterns in timing (automated attempts)
```

#### üé´ **Event ID 4771: Kerberos Pre-authentication Failed**
```powershell
# LDAP password spraying detection:
- Requires Kerberos logging enabled
- Multiple pre-auth failures from single source
- Indicates more sophisticated attackers avoiding SMB
```

### üìà **Detection Rules and Queries**

#### üîç **SIEM Query Examples**
```sql
-- PowerShell/Splunk Query for Password Spray Detection
index=security EventCode=4625 
| stats count by src_ip, user 
| where count > 3 
| stats count by src_ip 
| where count > 10

-- KQL Query for Azure Sentinel
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize FailedAttempts = count() by SourceIP = IpAddress, TimeGenerated
| where FailedAttempts > 5
```

#### üö® **Alert Thresholds**
```powershell
# Recommended alerting criteria:
- 5+ failed logins from single IP within 5 minutes
- 10+ unique usernames targeted from single source
- Failed login attempts outside business hours
- Geographic anomalies (impossible travel)
- Service account lockouts (often targeted)
```

### üïµÔ∏è **Behavioral Analytics**
```powershell
# Advanced detection methods:
- Baseline normal authentication patterns
- Detect deviations in login timing
- Identify unusual source locations
- Monitor for distributed spraying (multiple IPs)
- Correlate with other attack indicators
```

## üåê External Password Spraying Targets

### üìã **Common External Targets**
```powershell
# Microsoft 365 and Exchange:
- Microsoft 365 (Office 365)
- Outlook Web Exchange (OWE)
- Exchange Web Access (EWA)
- Skype for Business
- Microsoft Teams
- OneDrive for Business

# Remote Access Solutions:
- Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS) Portals
- Citrix portals with AD authentication
- VDI implementations (VMware Horizon, etc.)
- VPN portals (Citrix, SonicWall, OpenVPN, Fortinet)

# Collaboration and Custom Apps:
- SharePoint Online
- Custom web applications using AD authentication
- Intranet portals
- Business applications with SAML/SSO
```

### üéØ **External Spraying Considerations**
```powershell
# Attack adaptations for external targets:
- Slower timing to avoid detection
- Distributed source IPs (residential proxies)
- User-Agent rotation
- Session management
- CAPTCHA bypass techniques
- Account enumeration before spraying
```
