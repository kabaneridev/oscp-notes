# Credential Hunting in Network Traffic

## üéØ Overview

**Network traffic credential hunting** focuses on intercepting and analyzing unencrypted network communications to extract credentials, authentication tokens, and sensitive information. While most modern applications use encryption (TLS/SSL), legacy systems, misconfigured services, and test environments often still transmit credentials in cleartext.

> **"Legacy systems, misconfigured services, or test applications launched without HTTPS can still result in the use of unencrypted protocols, presenting valuable opportunities for credential hunting."**

## üîì Cleartext vs Encrypted Protocols

### Common Unencrypted Protocols
| Unencrypted Protocol | Encrypted Counterpart | Description | Credential Risk |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **HTTP** | HTTPS | Web pages and resources | ‚ö†Ô∏è Forms, Basic Auth, Cookies |
| **FTP** | FTPS/SFTP | File transfer | ‚ö†Ô∏è Username/Password in AUTH |
| **SNMP** | SNMPv3 (encrypted) | Network device monitoring | ‚ö†Ô∏è Community strings |
| **POP3** | POP3S | Email retrieval | ‚ö†Ô∏è Username/Password |
| **IMAP** | IMAPS | Email access | ‚ö†Ô∏è Username/Password |
| **SMTP** | SMTPS | Email sending | ‚ö†Ô∏è AUTH credentials |
| **LDAP** | LDAPS | Directory services | ‚ö†Ô∏è Bind credentials |
| **Telnet** | SSH | Remote terminal | ‚ö†Ô∏è All keystrokes |
| **DNS** | DNS over HTTPS (DoH) | Domain resolution | ‚ö†Ô∏è Query information |
| **SMB v1/v2** | SMB 3.0 with TLS | File sharing | ‚ö†Ô∏è NTLM hashes |
| **VNC** | VNC with TLS/SSL | Remote desktop | ‚ö†Ô∏è Passwords, screen data |

### Risk Assessment
```bash
# High Risk (Credentials in cleartext)
- HTTP Basic Authentication
- FTP LOGIN/PASS commands
- Telnet login sessions
- SNMP community strings
- Unencrypted email protocols

# Medium Risk (Hashes/tokens)
- NTLM authentication over SMB
- Kerberos tickets
- HTTP NTLM headers

# Information Disclosure
- DNS queries revealing internal infrastructure
- HTTP headers with version information
- SNMP system information
```

## üîç Wireshark Analysis Techniques

### Essential Wireshark Filters

#### Network and Transport Layer Filters
```bash
# IP Address filtering
ip.addr == 192.168.1.100           # Specific IP traffic
ip.src == 192.168.1.100            # Source IP
ip.dst == 192.168.1.100            # Destination IP
ip.src == 192.168.1.100 && ip.dst == 10.0.0.1  # Between specific hosts

# Port filtering
tcp.port == 80                     # HTTP traffic
tcp.port == 21                     # FTP traffic
tcp.port == 23                     # Telnet traffic
udp.port == 161                    # SNMP traffic
tcp.port == 443                    # HTTPS traffic (for comparison)

# MAC Address filtering
eth.addr == 00:11:22:33:44:55      # Specific MAC address
```

#### Protocol-Specific Filters
```bash
# HTTP Analysis
http                               # All HTTP traffic
http.request.method == "POST"      # POST requests (likely credentials)
http.request.method == "GET"       # GET requests
http.response.code == 401          # Authentication required
http.response.code == 403          # Forbidden (auth failure)

# Authentication Headers
http.authorization                 # HTTP Basic/NTLM auth
http contains "Authorization: Basic"  # Basic auth specifically
http contains "WWW-Authenticate"   # Auth challenges

# FTP Analysis
ftp                               # All FTP traffic
ftp.request.command == "USER"     # Username commands
ftp.request.command == "PASS"     # Password commands
ftp.request.command == "RETR"     # File downloads
ftp.request.command == "STOR"     # File uploads

# Email Protocol Analysis
pop                               # POP3 traffic
imap                              # IMAP traffic
smtp                              # SMTP traffic

# Network Management
snmp                              # SNMP traffic
ldap                              # LDAP traffic
```

#### Advanced Filtering Techniques
```bash
# TCP Stream Analysis
tcp.stream eq 0                   # Follow specific TCP conversation
tcp.stream eq 1                   # Next TCP stream

# TCP Flags
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0  # SYN packets (connection attempts)
tcp.flags.rst == 1                # Reset packets (connection issues)

# Content-based filtering
frame contains "password"          # Packets containing "password"
frame contains "login"            # Packets containing "login"
frame contains "user"             # Packets containing "user"
tcp contains "admin"              # TCP packets with "admin"

# Credential hunting patterns
http contains "passw"             # HTTP with password patterns
ftp contains "230"                # FTP login success
telnet contains "login:"          # Telnet login prompts
```

### Wireshark Search Techniques

#### Manual Packet Search
```bash
# Via Display Filter
1. Enter filter: http contains "password"
2. Apply filter
3. Analyze results

# Via Find Packet (Ctrl+F)
1. Edit ‚Üí Find Packet
2. Search Options:
   - Display filter
   - Hex value
   - String
   - Regular expression

# String searches
"password"
"login"
"auth"
"admin"
"secret"
```

#### Following TCP Streams
```bash
# Right-click packet ‚Üí Follow ‚Üí TCP Stream
# Shows complete conversation between hosts
# Useful for:
- HTTP request/response pairs
- FTP command sequences
- Telnet login sessions
- SMTP email transmissions
```
