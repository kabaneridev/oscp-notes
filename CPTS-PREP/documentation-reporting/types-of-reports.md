# Types of Reports

## 🎯 Overview

**Report structure varies** based on assessment type and client requirements. Understanding different assessment methodologies and their corresponding report formats ensures appropriate deliverables for **vulnerability assessments**, **penetration tests**, **attestation reports**, and **specialized assessments**.

## 📊 Assessment Types

### 🔍 Vulnerability Assessment
```cmd
# Characteristics:
- Automated scanning (authenticated/unauthenticated)
- No exploitation attempted
- Scanner result validation
- False positive identification

# Scope variations:
- External: Internet-facing systems
- Internal: Behind-firewall network scan
- Credentialed: Domain account context
- Anonymous: Unauthenticated scanning
```

### ⚔️ Penetration Testing
```cmd
# Characteristics:
- Beyond automated scanning
- Active exploitation attempts
- Lateral/vertical movement
- Complete attack chain demonstration

# Testing perspectives:
- Black box: Company name only
- Grey box: IP ranges/network access
- White box: Credentials, source code, configs

# Evasion levels:
- Zero evasion: Maximum vulnerability discovery
- Hybrid: Start evasive, escalate when detected
- Full evasive: Remain undetected throughout
```

## 📋 Report Categories

### 🔍 Internal Penetration Test Report

```

### 📑 Vulnerability Assessment Report
```cmd

# RoE requirements:
- Destructive testing limits
- Device return expectations
- Component modification boundaries
- Safety and functionality preservation
```

## 📄 Additional Deliverables

### 📊 Attestation Report/Letter
```cmd
# Purpose:
- Third-party compliance evidence
- Vendor/customer requirements
- General security posture validation

# Content (1-2 pages):
- Number of findings discovered
- Assessment methodology used
- General environment comments
- NO specific technical details
- NO credentials or sensitive data
```

### 📈 Presentation Slide Deck
```cmd
# Audience considerations:
- Technical vs Executive focus
- Industry-specific examples
- Current event correlations
- Relatable risk scenarios

# Content strategy:
- Avoid purely statistical presentations
- Include relevant anecdotes
- Industry-specific attack examples
- Actionable recommendations
```

### 📋 Findings Spreadsheet
```cmd
# Format:
- Tabular finding layout
- Sortable by severity/category
- Import-friendly for ticketing systems
- Pivot table analytics

# Contents:
- Finding titles and descriptions
- Severity ratings
- Affected hosts
- Remediation recommendations
- NO executive summary content
```

### 🚨 Vulnerability Notifications
```cmd
# When to issue:
- Critical internet-exposed RCE
- Unauthenticated sensitive data exposure
- Default/weak credential systems
- Client-specified threshold findings

# Content (minimal):
- Technical finding details
- Exploitation evidence
- Immediate remediation steps
- NO excessive narrative content
```

## 🔄 Report Lifecycle

### 📝 Draft Report Process
```cmd
# Client collaboration approach:
1. Submit draft report
2. Client review period
3. Feedback incorporation meeting
4. Management response integration
5. Language/presentation adjustments
6. Final report delivery

# Benefits:
- Client input incorporation
- Board presentation optimization
- Security roadmap integration
- Compliance requirement fulfillment
```

### 🔁 Post-Remediation Testing
```cmd
# Scope limitations:
- Original findings only
- Original affected hosts only
- Time-limited window
- NO new environment scanning

# Potential issues:
- Environment changes over time
- Scope creep with new discoveries
- Severity modification pressure
- Compliance timeline conflicts

# Solutions:
- Treat as new assessment if needed
- Document time passage impact
- Focus on original scope only
- Maintain ethical boundaries
```
