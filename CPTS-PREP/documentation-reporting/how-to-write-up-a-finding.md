# How to Write Up a Finding

## üéØ Overview

**Findings are the "meat" of penetration testing reports** - showcasing discovered vulnerabilities, exploitation evidence, and remediation guidance. Detailed findings help technical teams reproduce issues, validate fixes, and support post-remediation assessments.

## üìã Essential Finding Components

### üîç Required Elements
```cmd
# Minimum finding information:
1. Description           # Vulnerability explanation and affected platforms
2. Impact               # Risk if left unresolved
3. Affected Systems     # Specific hosts/networks/applications
4. Remediation         # Actionable fix recommendations
5. References          # External resources for additional information
6. Reproduction Steps  # Evidence and step-by-step validation

# Optional elements:
- CVE numbers
- OWASP/MITRE IDs
- CVSS scores
- Ease of exploitation
- Attack probability
- Additional context
```

### üìä Finding Structure Template
```markdown
## [Finding Title]

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Severity** | High/Medium/Low |
| **CVSS Score** | X.X (if applicable) |
| **Affected Systems** | Specific hosts/networks |
| **CVE** | CVE-YYYY-XXXXX (if applicable) |

### Description
[Clear explanation of vulnerability and root cause]

### Impact
[Business risk if left unresolved]

### Remediation
[Actionable, specific fix recommendations]

### References
[Quality external resources]

### Reproduction Steps
[Step-by-step evidence with screenshots/output]
```

## üîç Evidence Best Practices

### üìä Reproduction Steps Guidelines
```cmd
# Structure principles:
- Break each step into separate figures
- Include full tool configuration
- Write narrative between figures
- Explain thought process
- Offer alternative validation tools

# Evidence quality:
- Completely defensible proof
- Clear cause-and-effect demonstration
- Client environment verification
- Professional presentation
```

### üì∑ Screenshot Standards
```cmd
# Requirements:
- Include URL/address bar
- Show ifconfig/ipconfig for host verification
- Disable bookmarks bar
- Remove unprofessional browser extensions
- Crop to relevant information
- Add minimal annotations for clarity

# Avoid:
- Random internet images
- Generic vulnerability screenshots
- Unclear context or location
- Unprofessional browser setup
```

### üíª Terminal Output Presentation
```cmd
# Preferred: Copy-paste terminal text
# Benefits:
- Client can copy-paste commands
- Easier redaction
- Professional appearance
- Smaller file sizes

# Example format:
‚îå‚îÄ[htb-student]‚îÄ[10.10.14.3]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïº $ crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u administrator -p '<REDACTED>'
SMB    172.16.5.5    445    DC01    [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\administrator:<REDACTED> (Pwn3d!)
```

## üìù Remediation Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Good Remediation Examples
```cmd
# Specific and actionable:
"To remediate this finding, update the following registry values:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RestrictAnonymous = 2
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RestrictAnonymousSAM = 1

Note: Registry changes should be tested in a small group before enterprise deployment."

# Multiple options provided:
"There are different approaches to address this finding:
1. [Vendor] has published an official workaround (see references)
2. Commercial tools are available but may be cost-prohibitive
3. Interim mitigation can be achieved through network segmentation"
```

### ‚ùå Bad Remediation Examples
```cmd
# Vague and unhelpful:
"Reconfigure your registry settings to harden against X"
"An attacker can own your whole network cause your DC is way out of date. You should really fix that!"
"Implement [expensive commercial tool] to address this finding"

# Problems:
- No specific steps
- Unprofessional language
- Only expensive solutions
- No context or warnings
```

## üéØ Sample Finding Examples

### üîë Kerberoasting Finding
```markdown
## Weak Kerberos Authentication ("Kerberoasting")

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Severity** | High |
| **CVSS Score** | 9.5 |
| **Affected Systems** | INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain |
| **CVE** | N/A (Configuration Issue) |

### Description
Service accounts in the Active Directory domain are configured with Service Principal Names (SPNs) that allow any authenticated domain user to request Kerberos tickets encrypted with the service account's password. These tickets can be extracted and subjected to offline password cracking attacks.

### Impact
Successful exploitation provides attackers with service account credentials that often have elevated privileges, enabling lateral movement and potential domain compromise.

### Remediation
1. Enable AES encryption for Kerberos (disable RC4)
2. Implement Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)
3. Use 25+ character complex passwords for service accounts
4. Regular password rotation for service accounts
5. Monitor for unusual TGS ticket requests

### üåê Web Application Finding
```markdown
## Tomcat Manager Weak/Default Credentials

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Severity** | High |
| **CVSS Score** | 9.5 |
| **Affected Systems** | 192.168.195.205:8080 |

### Description
Apache Tomcat Manager application is accessible with default credentials (tomcat:tomcat), allowing unauthorized administrative access and potential remote code execution.

### Impact
Attackers can deploy malicious web applications (WAR files) leading to complete server compromise and potential lateral movement within the network.

### Remediation
1. Change default Tomcat Manager credentials immediately
2. Restrict access to management interface by IP
3. Disable Tomcat Manager if not required
4. Implement strong authentication mechanisms
5. Regular credential rotation policy
