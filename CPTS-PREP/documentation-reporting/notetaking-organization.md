# Notetaking & Organization

## üéØ Overview

**Thorough notetaking** is critical during assessments. Notes and tool output become the **raw inputs** for reports - typically the **only deliverable** clients see. Organized documentation saves time during reporting and provides essential references for client questions and team collaboration.

## üìã Essential Notetaking Structure

### Core Categories
```cmd
# Primary sections for comprehensive documentation:
1. Attack Path           # Complete exploitation chain with screenshots
2. Credentials          # Centralized credential tracking
3. Findings            # Individual vulnerabilities with evidence
4. Vulnerability Scan Research    # Scanner analysis and research
5. Service Enumeration Research   # Service investigation notes
6. Web Application Research      # Web app discoveries and testing
7. AD Enumeration Research       # Active Directory investigation
8. OSINT                # Open source intelligence gathering
9. Administrative Information    # Contacts, objectives, RoE
10. Scoping Information         # IP ranges, URLs, provided credentials
11. Activity Log               # High-level activity tracking
12. Payload Log               # Uploaded files and cleanup tracking
```

### Folder Structure
```bash
# Recommended directory organization:
mkdir -p PROJECT/{Admin,Deliverables,Evidence/{Findings,Scans/{Vuln,Service,Web,'AD Enumeration'},Notes,OSINT,Wireless,'Logging output','Misc Files'},Retest}

# Result:
PROJECT/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Admin/                    # SOW, kickoff notes, status reports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deliverables/            # Reports, spreadsheets, presentations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Evidence/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Findings/           # Per-finding evidence folders
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scans/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vuln/          # Vulnerability scanner output
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service/       # Nmap, Masscan results
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Web/           # Burp, ZAP, EyeWitness data
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AD Enumeration/ # BloodHound, PowerView data
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Notes/              # Structured note files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OSINT/             # Intelligence gathering output
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Wireless/          # WiFi testing results
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Logging output/    # Tmux, tool logs
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Misc Files/        # Payloads, scripts, tools
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Retest/                # Retest evidence (separate)
```

```

## üì∫ Tmux Logging Setup

### Installation
```bash
# Clone Tmux Plugin Manager
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm

# Create configuration file
cat > ~/.tmux.conf << EOF
# List of plugins
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-logging'

# Increase history limit
set -g history-limit 50000

# Initialize TMUX plugin manager (keep at bottom)
run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
EOF

# Apply configuration
tmux source ~/.tmux.conf
```

### Usage
```bash
# Start new session
tmux new -s assessment

# Install plugins (first time)
# Press: Ctrl+B, Shift+I

# Start logging current session
# Press: Ctrl+B, Shift+P

# Stop logging
# Press: Ctrl+B, Shift+P (again)

# Retroactive logging (save current pane)
# Press: Ctrl+B, Alt+Shift+P

# Screen capture of current pane
# Press: Ctrl+B, Alt+P

# Clear pane history
# Press: Ctrl+B, Alt+C
```

### Key Bindings
```cmd
# Essential Tmux commands:
Ctrl+B, Shift+%     # Split panes vertically
Ctrl+B, Shift+"     # Split panes horizontally  
Ctrl+B, O           # Switch between panes
Ctrl+B, Shift+P     # Start/stop logging
Ctrl+B, Alt+Shift+P # Retroactive logging
Ctrl+B, Alt+P       # Screen capture
```

## üìä Evidence Collection

### What to Capture
```cmd
# High-priority evidence:
- Command execution and output
- Screenshots of GUI applications
- Network scan results
- Vulnerability scanner output
- Successful exploitation attempts
- Failed attempts (for thoroughness)
- System information and configuration
- Credential discoveries
```

### Screenshot Best Practices
```cmd
# Technical guidelines:
- Include address bar in browser screenshots
- Crop to relevant information only
- Add minimal border for document contrast
- Use annotations (arrows, boxes) for clarity
- Redact credentials and PII properly

# Redaction methods:
‚úÖ Solid black bars (secure)
‚ùå Pixelation/blurring (reversible)
‚ùå CSS/HTML styling (easily bypassed)
```

### Terminal Output Formatting
```cmd
# Preferred: Copy-paste terminal text
# Benefits:
- Easier redaction and highlighting
- Smaller file sizes
- Copy-paste friendly for client reproduction
- Professional appearance

# Format example:
‚îå‚îÄ[htb-student]‚îÄ[10.10.14.3]‚îÄ[~/tools]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïº $ crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u administrator -p '<REDACTED>'
SMB    172.16.5.5    445    DC01    [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\administrator:<REDACTED> (Pwn3d!)
```

## üìù Artifact Tracking

### Payload Documentation
```cmd
# Essential tracking information:
- Timestamp of payload deployment
- Target host IP/hostname
- File path on target system
- File hash (SHA256/MD5)
- Cleanup status (removed/needs cleanup)
- Purpose/functionality of payload
```

### System Modifications
```cmd
# Required documentation:
- Host IP/hostname where change was made
- Timestamp of modification
- Description of change made
- Location of change on host
- Application/service affected
- Account created (if applicable)
- Reversion status and procedures
```

### Sample Tracking Format
```markdown
## Payload Log

| Timestamp | Host | Path | Hash | Status | Notes |
|-----------|------|------|------|--------|-------|
| 2025-01-15 14:30 | 10.10.10.50 | C:\temp\shell.exe | a1b2c3d4... | Removed | Reverse shell payload |
| 2025-01-15 15:45 | 10.10.10.51 | /var/www/html/cmd.php | e5f6g7h8... | Needs cleanup | Web shell |

## Account Modifications

| Timestamp | Host | Change | Account | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|---------|--------|
| 2025-01-15 16:00 | DC01 | User created | testuser | Removed |
| 2025-01-15 16:15 | WEB01 | Added to Admins | htb-user | Reverted |
