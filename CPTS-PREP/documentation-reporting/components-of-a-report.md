# Components of a Report

## 🎯 Overview

**The report is the main deliverable** clients pay for during penetration tests. It must demonstrate work performed, provide maximum value, and be free of extraneous data. Everything included should have a clear purpose and help clients prioritize remediation efforts.

## 📋 Core Report Structure

### 🎯 Executive Summary
```cmd
# Purpose:
- Written for non-technical stakeholders
- Budget allocation decision makers
- Board of Directors presentation
- Funding justification support

# Key principles:
- 1.5-2 pages maximum
- No technical jargon or acronyms
- Specific metrics (not "several" or "multiple")
- Business impact focus
- Remediation effort estimates
```

### ⚔️ Attack Chain
```cmd
# Purpose:
- Demonstrate exploitation path
- Show finding interconnections
- Justify severity ratings
- Evidence for individual findings

# Structure:
1. Summary of complete attack path
2. Step-by-step walkthrough
3. Supporting command output
4. Screenshots for GUI interactions
5. Impact demonstration
```

### 🔍 Findings Section
```cmd
# Content:
- Technical vulnerability details
- Exploitation evidence
- Reproduction steps
- Remediation recommendations
- Risk assessment justification

# Organization:
- Severity-based ordering
- Clear finding titles
- Consistent formatting
- Complete evidence packages
```

### 📊 Summary of Recommendations
```cmd
# Timeframe categories:
- Short-term: Immediate patches/fixes
- Medium-term: Process improvements
- Long-term: Strategic security enhancements

# Requirements:
- Tie back to specific findings
- Actionable recommendations only
- Effort level estimates
- Business impact consideration
```

## 📝 Executive Summary Best Practices

### ✅ DO
```cmd
# Content guidelines:
- Use specific numbers instead of vague terms
- Describe accessible systems/data types
- Explain general improvement areas
- Include remediation effort estimates
- Focus on high-impact findings

# Writing style:
- Non-technical language
- Clear, concise sentences
- Business impact focus
- Universal understanding
- Attention-grabbing content
```

### ❌ DON'T
```cmd
# Avoid:
- Specific vendor recommendations
- Technical acronyms (SNMP, MitM)
- References to technical sections
- Obscure vocabulary
- Excessive detail on minor findings

# Common mistakes:
- More than 2 pages length
- Technical jargon usage
- Assumption of technical knowledge
- Ambiguous metrics
- Overwhelming detail
```

### 🔄 Technical Term Translation
```cmd
# Professional vocabulary conversion:
VPN/SSH → "secure remote administration protocol"
SSL/TLS → "secure web browsing technology"
Hash → "cryptographic password validation"
Password Spraying → "automated weak password testing"
Buffer Overflow → "remote command execution attack"
OSINT → "public information gathering"
SQL Injection → "database manipulation vulnerability"
```

## 📊 Sample Attack Chain Structure

### 🎯 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Example
```cmd
# Attack progression:
1. LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning → bsmith user hash
2. Offline hash cracking → domain foothold
3. BloodHound enumeration → privilege mapping
4. Kerberoasting attack → mssqlsvc account
5. Credential extraction → srvadmin cleartext
6. Lateral movement → pramirez TGT ticket
7. Pass-the-Ticket → DCSync privileges
8. Domain compromise → Administrator hash
9. Full domain control → NTDS database dump

# Evidence components:
- Responder output (hash capture)
- Hashcat results (password cracking)
- BloodHound graphs (privilege paths)
- GetUserSPNs output (Kerberoasting)
- CrackMapExec LSA dumps (credential extraction)
- Rubeus ticket operations (Pass-the-Ticket)
- Mimikatz DCSync (domain compromise)
```

## 📋 Report Appendices

### 🔒 Static Appendices (Always Include)
```cmd
